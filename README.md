Here are the key enhancements:

Code Refinement: I have thoroughly reviewed and improved the existing code to enhance its readability, efficiency, and overall quality.

Comments for Better Understanding: To facilitate better comprehension for both current and future developers, I have added comprehensive comments throughout the codebase. These comments provide insights into the functionality, logic, and purpose of different sections of the code.

Integration of Docker: In order to streamline deployment and ensure consistency across various environments, I have integrated Docker into the project. This will simplify the setup process and enhance the portability of the application.

Error Handling Improvements: I have implemented robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that the code gracefully handles unexpected scenarios. This will contribute to the overall stability and reliability of the application.
